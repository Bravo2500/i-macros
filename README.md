# To use with iMacros

So the idea is to use iMacros to auto-visit linkedin profiles.

Two scripts are available :

```
linkedin-auto-visits-groups.js
```
To visit people profiles of members belonging to a group

and

```
linkedin-auto-visits-people-search.js
```
To visit people profiles from the result of a reasearch you made.

Don't forget to go in the People menu element before copying the URL.

The scripts are originally comming from: https://github.com/LeCoupa/kgh-imacros
